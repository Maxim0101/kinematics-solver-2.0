# kinematics-solver-2.0

In high school, when I was in physics class, I designed a physics calculator using JavaScript to solve kinematic problems from class using the 5 kinematic equations we learned. Unfortunately, the code to the original program was lost when my school account was deleted.

This project recreates my old program but better because it also uses html and css to create a friendly user interface. 

In this project, you will find... 
- an html file, which contains html code and a JavaScript (the presentation and functionality of the website)
- a css file, which contains the styling for the html code
- a png image, which is placed on the tab

Here is the summary of the functionality:
- There are 5 input boxes for 5 different variables that the kinematic equations use. These variables are Initial Velocity, Final Velocity, Acceleration, Time, and Displacement. 
- You must input at least 3 variables for the code to run since every problem requires at least 3 variables. If you put less, the website tells you that you need to add more variables.
- Once you follow the guidelines, the submit button will appear green, and you can click it.
- Once you submit your data, the html file uses a script to figure out what variables need to be solved and then solves those variables with the equations from kinematics.
- It then presents the formula it used, its work, and then the results at the bottom of the webpage. If the program had to solve for 1 variable, it will present the results centered at the bottom of the webpage. If the program had to solve for 2 variables, it will present both results side by side. 
- And that's how it essentially works!

If you would like to run the code, I would use VS code since that's what I used to do the project.
